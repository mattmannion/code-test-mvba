Thanks for looking at my screening question answser.

This took me an hour or so to build. This has basically zero styling, however it could be styled in anyway you'd want with all the pieces needed working to spec.

To have this application work you need to run 'npm run d' to run the react app, and you need to cd into server and run 'npm run d' to start the golang rest api. Once both are loaded you can operate the application and inspect the code.
